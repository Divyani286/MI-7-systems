Overall idea is as following:

We have following modules:
- School management
- Society Management
- Business management
- Hospital management
- Banks
- Social/Entertainment entities (Temples, Theaters etc)

Goal is to create an overall eco-system, called AnantWorld (Infinity World). 
It should be a small world on its own. 
- world will have a set of people
    - different number of people
        - different ages
        - they will be doing different things
            - depending on the age, going to school
            - be part of a business
            - go to hospital
            - join a socity
            - attend different events
        - leave some of these entities etc. 

Phase 1:
- 4 modules for services
- 1 People module needs to be added
- Docker for each service
- Each service exposing its operations thru TCP / IP requests
- A CLI in the people module to drive the whole AW (Anand World)
