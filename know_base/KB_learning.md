        - subtopic: Question or section or a para
            - Content:

            - delete
            - Makefile

Any activity you do in your whole day:

1. you are taking one or more KB item,
    - using them and writing code
    - writing test cases 
    - running test cases
    - debugging program
    - design 
        - product KB itemss
2. you are adding / updating KB items

Working on your project:
1. Team meeting: At fixed time and must generated meeting.md file and must have clear action items for everyone in the meeting.
2. Try to understand a new concept, socket programming, docker, read/write system call. You are consuming some KB item. And if you don't find what you are looking in KB, then you should create a new KB item for others to consume. And if needed, add even the sample program.
3. Project: 
    - Design, this consume design doc or update/produce design doc. 
    - Coding: you must make sure that whatever concept you are consuming, you have a sample program for that concept in KB. And if that is missing then please add that sample program in KB.
    - Debugging: Again make sure that any debugging tech/trick that you are using is documented in KB, so that everyone can be benefited from this.
    - Test cases: Make sure that every test case is documented
